Job analysis is a systematic procedure to analyse the requirements for the job role and job profile. Glassdoor is a website and online platform that provides information about jobs, salaries, and companies. Job analysis is a systematic approach to defining the job role, description, requirements, responsibilities, evaluation, etc. It helps in finding out the required level of education, skills, knowledge, training, etc for the job position. It also depicts the job worth i.e. measurable effectiveness of the job and contribution of job to the organization. Thus, it effectively contributes to setting up the compensation package for the job position.
